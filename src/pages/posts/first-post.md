# My First Amazing Blog Post

Published on: 2023-08-31

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning everything that comes across my adventure! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build projects on my way to becoming a better Front end engineer.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project from scratch trying to migrate my previous blog that was made in Next.js. Didn't work out, So I deleted my entire project bit by bit and started from zero. Pretty fun.

2. **Learning Astro and Markdown posts creation**: I then learned how to make pages, posts and layouts. Tried to compare it to what I already learned using Next.js and what I was seeing on [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and trying to find which would have the best DX for creating a blog, a simple, fast approach, similar to writting HTML, CSS, JS. It took me one minute literally to figure it out that Astro would make my journey way easier than any other alternative. **AND** I can use whatever other UI technology I want. which is always cool to have.

So far, This is what i've done in the re-do of my portfolio.

## What's next

I'm thinking to keep sharing content what would deliver value to the community. Specially for devs, but also other general themes like well-being, which I really like as well.

Hope to see you later!
