Upfront, the resource is: [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher), an Open Source program. Credits to [Valentin-Gabriel Radu](https://valinet.ro/).

It has everything you need to tweak the windonws 11 taskbar, specially move it to the side, what I was looking for.

Hope one day would be a more approchable easy way to do this.

See you later.
